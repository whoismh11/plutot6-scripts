### Requirements
[GSC Toolkit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j_ocjFCQsFaWqF2-PfdoJt2nF_EpNL_G/view?usp=sharing) (Required to compile your script).

### How to use
1. Using the GSC Compiler (from GSC Toolkit), simply drag and drop your raw GSC script ontop of `Compiler.exe` and it should spit out a compiled version. If you get an error, make sure your script isn't already precompiled (open it, and if it looks like gibberish, it is already compiled).
2. Navigate to the T6 Plutonium folder by pressing `Win+R` and pasting `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6` into it, and hitting Ok.
3. Create a folder called `scripts`, then inside that folder, create two new folders called `mp`, and `zm`.
4. Take your compiled script and put it in `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\mp` or `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm` depending on which mode it is for. If your script should always be loaded no matter the game mode copy it to `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts`.
5. When launching your server or a custom game, you will know if all has gone well or not if the console prints `Custom script 'scripts/mp/yourScriptName' loaded`.
